# SmartLocate.Commons

This project is a shared library that contains common code that is used by other microservices in the SmartLocate application.

The difference between this project and the [SmartLocate.Infrastructure.Commons](../SmartLocate.Infrastructure.Commons/README.md) project is that this project does not contain any logic and instead only contains POCO, attributes, constants and enums.
